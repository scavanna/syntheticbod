Let me think about this:

China:

<br>

Already included: Alibaba (Qwen/Cloud), Huawei, DeepSeek

Missing: Baidu (Ernie Bot/ERNIE 4.0), Tencent (Hunyuan), ByteDance (Doubao/Coze), Zhipu AI (GLM), Moonshot AI (Kimi), Sensetime, Baidu PaddlePaddle, Midea/Haier AI, Cambricon, Biren Technology, iFlytek

<br>

South Korea:

<br>

Missing: Samsung SDS, LG AI Research (EXAONE), Naver (HyperCLOVA X), Kakao (KoGPT), SK Telecom (A.), Upstage (Solar LLM), KT Corp, FuriosaAI (chips), Krafton AI, Lunit (medical AI)

<br>

Japan:

<br>

Missing: NTT (tsuzumi), Fujitsu (Kozuchi), NEC, SoftBank, Preferred Networks, Ricoh, Docomo, Sony AI, Toyota Research Institute

<br>

India:

<br>

Missing: TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL, and various startups focused on enterprise solutions

<br>

Singapore:

<br>

AI Singapore, SEA Group (Shopee/Garena), Grab AI

<br>

Now I'm filtering these by actual relevance to the LATAM B2B market. The Indian IT services firms—TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL, Tech Mahindra—stand out as particularly important because they already have extensive operations and client bases throughout Latin America and are major AI service integrators. Japanese companies like NTT Data and Fujitsu also have established LATAM presences, while Korean and most Chinese companies have limited regional footprints currently, though Alibaba Cloud and Huawei do maintain some LATAM operations.
