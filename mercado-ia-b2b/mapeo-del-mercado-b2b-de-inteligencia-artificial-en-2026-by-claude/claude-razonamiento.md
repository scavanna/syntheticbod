Estructuró análisis exhaustivo del mercado B2B de IA por segmentos

The user wants a comprehensive analysis of the B2B AI market as of February 2026, covering:

<br>

Types of AI products/technologies/models/capabilities available for B2B consumption

Market segmentation of providers

Top 12 players per segment (in table format, with possible repetitions)

Let me structure this from my knowledge - this is fairly stable information I can answer well without searching, though I'll note February 2026 is near my knowledge cutoff.

<br>

Let me organize this comprehensively.

<br>

Part 1: Types of AI products/technologies for B2B

<br>

Foundation Models / LLMs (text generation, reasoning)

Multimodal Models (vision, audio, video)

Embedding Models (semantic search, RAG)

Image/Video Generation Models

Speech-to-Text / Text-to-Speech

Code Generation / Developer Tools

AI Agents / Agentic Frameworks

AI-powered Applications (vertical SaaS with AI)

MLOps / AI Infrastructure Platforms

Vector Databases

AI APIs / Inference Platforms

Fine-tuning / Custom Model Training

Edge AI / On-device AI

AI for specific verticals (healthcare, legal, finance)

I'm continuing to map out the full landscape of B2B AI offerings, covering everything from core infrastructure and model serving to specialized applications across different industries. Generating the market segments table... Continuing through the automation and agent platforms like LangChain, Crew AI, and the major cloud providers' agent builders, then moving into horizontal applications across Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and creative tools like Adobe Firefly, before starting to map out vertical solutions beginning with healthcare offerings.

<br>

Now I'm reconsidering the vertical applications approach—rather than listing every industry separately, I should focus on representative players that span across different sectors to keep this more concise. Then I'm moving into the infrastructure layer with vector databases like Pinecone, Weaviate, and the vector search capabilities being added to established platforms like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Snowflake. Finally, I'm identifying the governance and security layer with players like Microsoft's AI security tools, IBM's governance platforms, and Scale for data quality and safety.

<br>

I'm also mapping out the hardware and compute segment, which includes the major chip manufacturers like NVIDIA and AMD, cloud providers' custom silicon like Google's TPUs and Amazon's Trainium chips, and emerging specialized AI hardware companies like Cerebras and Groq. Now I'm ready to organize all of this into a clear, structured format.
